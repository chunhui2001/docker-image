# This is the default config file. It allows all users to do anything,
# so don't use it on production systems.
#
# Look here for more config file examples:

# path to a directory with all packages
# 所有包的缓存目录
storage: ./storage
# path to a directory with plugins to include

  #enable: false
  title: Verdaccio

auth:
  htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    # Maximum amount of users allowed to register, defaults to "+inf".
    # You can set this to -1 to disable registration.
    # 为-1时，不允许用户通过 npm adduser 注册
    # 当为-1时，可以通过直接编写 htpasswd 文件内容的方式添加用户
    # 语法：用户名:{SHA}哈希加密的字符=:autocreated 时间
    # 加密算法：SHA1哈稀之后再转换成 Base64 输出就好
    #max_users: 1000

# You can specify HTTP/1.1 server keep alive timeout in seconds for incomming connections.
# A value of 0 makes the http server behave similarly to Node.js versions prior to 8.0.0, which did not have a keep-alive timeout.
# WORKAROUND: Through given configuration you can workaround following issue https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/301. Set to 0 in case 60 is not enought.
